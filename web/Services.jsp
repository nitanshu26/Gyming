            <p class="p1"><b>
                    A personal trainer is an individual certified
                    to have a varying degree of knowledge of general
                    fitness involved in exercise prescription and instruction.
                    They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and accountability to clients.
                    Trainers also measure their client's strengths and weaknesses with fitness assessments.
                    These fitness assessments may also be performed before and after an exercise program to measure 
                    their client's improvements in physical fitness.
                    They should also educate their clients in many other aspects of wellness besides exercise,
                    including general health and nutrition guidelines.
                    It is very important that a trainer takes their time to evaluate a client's personal life outside of the gym.
                    This way, personal trainers can figure out what kind of stress their client may be putting on certain areas
                    of the body during their every day lives.
